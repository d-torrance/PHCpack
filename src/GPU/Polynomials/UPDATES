Sat 19 Dec 2020 : convolution_jobs.h and convolution_jobs.cpp define a class
  to setup the layers of convolution jobs, tested by test_convolution_jobs.

Fri 18 Dec 2020 : extended test_convolution_jobs with layer counts.
  Extended test_convolution_jobs with a frequency table of layer counts.

  the counts in test_convolution_jobs.cpp.

Thu 17 Dec 2020 : new random_polynomials, updated dbl_polynomials_host and
  test_dbl_polynomials, so polynomials with one term are no longer special.
  Bug fix in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp for 2 variables in low dimension.
  Added verbose option to dbl_polynomials_host and test_dbl_polynomials.
  New test_convolution_jobs.cpp to collect all convolution jobs.

Wed 16 Dec 2020 : added test_dbl_polynomials.cpp, makefile and makefile_unix.
  Added makefile_windows.  New dbl_polynomials_host.h and .cpp.
