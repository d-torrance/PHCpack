Tue 29 Dec 2020 : in addition_jobs.cpp, corrected the dimension of the
  difcnt, which should be nbrvar instead of nbrmon.  The first derivative
  is correctly computed with addition jobs, as verified by the updates
  in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp.  Extended addition_job with a type for
  the increment.  Added the jobs for all derivaties to addition_jobs.
  Replaced not, and in addition_jobs.cpp and random_polynomials.cpp.

Mon 28 Dec 2020 : extended random_polynomials with a check on duplicate
  support vectors, tested in test_dbl_polynomials.cpp.
  To test_addition_jobs.cpp, added differential indices computation.
  Moved the differential indices from test_addition_jobs into the class
  addition_jobs, updated test_dbl_polynomials.  Extended addition_job.cpp
  with the coefficient output.  Added the definition of the jobs for the
  first derivative to addition_jobs, tested by test_addition_jobs.

Sun 27 Dec 2020 : bug fix, in addition_jobs and test_addition_jobs,
  the dimension is the number of monomials, not the number of variables.
  Added recursive make of jobs to addition_jobs, test_addition_jobs.
  In addition_job.h, fixed the ifndef label.  In dbl_polynomials_host,
  added the application of the addition jobs, tested by test_dbl_polynomials.

Sat 26 Dec 2020 : new class in addition_job, used in test_addition_jobs.
  New class in addition_jobs, updated addition_job.cpp and test_addition_jobs.

  New test_addition_jobs.cpp to define the reduction tree of additions.

Thu 24 Dec 2020 : bug fixed in dbl_polynomials_kernels, the computation of
  the job indices does not need the cumulative sums; test_dbl_polynomials
  verifies that the polynomial value with GPU convolutions is correct.
  To dbl_polynomials_kernels, test_dbl_polynomials added computation and
  test on all other derivatives.  Fixes in dbl_polynomials_kernels...
  Fixed the last indexing bug in dbl_polynomials_kernels.cu.

Wed 23 Dec 2020 : edited dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and test_dbl_polynomials.
  Added a first setup for the preparation of the convolution jobs in
  dbl_polynomials_kernels.h and dbl_polynomials_kernels.cu.
  Updated dbl_polynomials_kernels and test_dbl_polynomials with a first
  definition of the kernel to compute all convolutions.
  In dbl_polynomials_kernels.cu, changed dim == BS into deg1 == BS.

Tue 22 Dec 2020 : updated dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and test_dbl_polynomials
  with the computation of first and last derivative.  Simplified 2-variable
  monomials, updated convolution_jobs.cpp and dbl_polynomials_host.cpp.
  Updated dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and test_dbl_polynomials.cpp,
  all derivatives are now computed correctly.
  Improved memory usage in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp.

Mon 21 Dec 2020 : fixed bug in output, in convolution_job.cpp.
  Added get_job() method in convolution_jobs.h, convolution_jobs.cpp,
  to write all convolution_jobs per layer in test_convolution_jobs.
  Bug fix in layer assignment in convolution_jobs.cpp.
  Extended dbl_polynomials_host with function to evaluate and differentiate
  in the order of the convolution layers, tested by test_dbl_polynomials.
  Fixed a bug in convolution_jobs.

Sun 20 Dec 2020 : updated the layer count for the cross products in
  convolution_jobs.cpp, removed functions from test_convolution_jobs.cpp.
  Added convolution_job.h and convolution_job.cpp to define the class
  to represent one convolution job.  Adjusted convolution_jobs.h and *.cpp.
  Updated makefile_windows, added return os statement in convolution_job.cpp.

Sat 19 Dec 2020 : convolution_jobs.h and convolution_jobs.cpp define a class
  to setup the layers of convolution jobs, tested by test_convolution_jobs.

Fri 18 Dec 2020 : extended test_convolution_jobs with layer counts.

  Improved the 2-variable case in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and adjusted
  the counts in test_convolution_jobs.cpp.

Thu 17 Dec 2020 : new random_polynomials, updated dbl_polynomials_host and
  test_dbl_polynomials, so polynomials with one term are no longer special.
  Bug fix in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp for 2 variables in low dimension.
  Added verbose option to dbl_polynomials_host and test_dbl_polynomials.
  New test_convolution_jobs.cpp to collect all convolution jobs.
