Wed 23 Dec 2020 : edited dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and test_dbl_polynomials.
  Added a first setup for the preparation of the convolution jobs in
  dbl_polynomials_kernels.h and dbl_polynomials_kernels.cu.
  Updated dbl_polynomials_kernels and test_dbl_polynomials with a first
  definition of the kernel to compute all convolutions.
  In dbl_polynomials_kernels.cu, changed dim == BS into deg1 == BS.

Tue 22 Dec 2020 : updated dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and test_dbl_polynomials
  with the computation of first and last derivative.  Simplified 2-variable
  monomials, updated convolution_jobs.cpp and dbl_polynomials_host.cpp.
  Updated dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and test_dbl_polynomials.cpp,
  all derivatives are now computed correctly.
  Improved memory usage in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp.

Mon 21 Dec 2020 : fixed bug in output, in convolution_job.cpp.
  Added get_job() method in convolution_jobs.h, convolution_jobs.cpp,
  to write all convolution_jobs per layer in test_convolution_jobs.
  Bug fix in layer assignment in convolution_jobs.cpp.
  Extended dbl_polynomials_host with function to evaluate and differentiate
  in the order of the convolution layers, tested by test_dbl_polynomials.
  Fixed a bug in convolution_jobs.

Sun 20 Dec 2020 : updated the layer count for the cross products in
  convolution_jobs.cpp, removed functions from test_convolution_jobs.cpp.
  Added convolution_job.h and convolution_job.cpp to define the class
  to represent one convolution job.  Adjusted convolution_jobs.h and *.cpp.
  Updated makefile_windows, added return os statement in convolution_job.cpp.

Sat 19 Dec 2020 : convolution_jobs.h and convolution_jobs.cpp define a class
  to setup the layers of convolution jobs, tested by test_convolution_jobs.

Fri 18 Dec 2020 : extended test_convolution_jobs with layer counts.
  Extended test_convolution_jobs with a frequency table of layer counts.
  Improved the 2-variable case in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp and adjusted
  the counts in test_convolution_jobs.cpp.

Thu 17 Dec 2020 : new random_polynomials, updated dbl_polynomials_host and
  test_dbl_polynomials, so polynomials with one term are no longer special.
  Bug fix in dbl_polynomials_host.cpp for 2 variables in low dimension.
  Added verbose option to dbl_polynomials_host and test_dbl_polynomials.
  New test_convolution_jobs.cpp to collect all convolution jobs.

Wed 16 Dec 2020 : added test_dbl_polynomials.cpp, makefile and makefile_unix.
  Added makefile_windows.  New dbl_polynomials_host.h and .cpp.
