Thu 11 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices with functions to generate
  upper triangular matrices of random power series.

Wed 10 Feb 2021 : new dbl_matrices_host with code extracted from the
  test_dbl_series_vectors.cpp.

Mon 8 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices with the generation of complex
  series matrices and test_dbl_series_vectors with a test on the complex
  matrix-vector product.

Sun 7 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices and test_dbl_series_vectors
  with functions to work with vectors of complex numbered series.

Sat 6 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices with function to generate
  one random vector and one random matrix.  Added matrix vector products
  and tests in test_dbl_series_vectors.cpp.

Fri 5 Feb 2021 : added the inner product to test_dbl_series_vectors.cpp.
