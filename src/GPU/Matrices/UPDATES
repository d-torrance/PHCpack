Sat 20 Feb 2021 : to dbl_matrices_host, added forward substitution and
  a function for a LU factorization solver.  Adjusted the forward
  substitution for systems with ones on the diagonal.  Added testers on
  the LU solver in dbl_matrices_testers, updated test_dbl_series_vectors.

Fri 19 Feb 2021 : extended dbl_matrices_host with a matrix-matrix product
  to test the code for the LU factorization in dbl_matrices_testers,
  called in test_dbl_series_vectors.cpp.  Updated makefiles because
  random_numbers are needed to randomize the exp(x) series.

Thu 18 Feb 2021 : added an inplace lu factorization to dbl_matrices_host.

Sun 14 Feb 2021 : added generation of random lower triangular matrices
  to random matrices.

Sat 13 Feb 2021 : to dbl_matrices_host, added an upper triangular solver
  for series with complex coefficients, extended test_dbl_series_vectors.
  Moved functions from test_dbl_series_vectors into dbl_matrices_testers.

Fri 12 Feb 2021 : added an upper triangular solver to dbl_matrices_host,
  tested by test_dbl_series_vectors.

Thu 11 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices with functions to generate
  upper triangular matrices of random power series.

Wed 10 Feb 2021 : new dbl_matrices_host with code extracted from the
  test_dbl_series_vectors.cpp.

Mon 8 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices with the generation of complex
  series matrices and test_dbl_series_vectors with a test on the complex
  matrix-vector product.

Sun 7 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices and test_dbl_series_vectors
  with functions to work with vectors of complex numbered series.

Sat 6 Feb 2021 : extended random_matrices with function to generate
  one random vector and one random matrix.  Added matrix vector products
  and tests in test_dbl_series_vectors.cpp.

Fri 5 Feb 2021 : added the inner product to test_dbl_series_vectors.cpp.
