Fri 26 Mar 2021 : new test_standard_lseries_polynomials with the tests
  taken from ts_lserpol.  Replace 'standard' by 'double' in the names
  of all packages in this folder.  This changed all ts_ files as well.

Thu 25 Mar 2021 : to standard_lseries_polynomials, added Table, Table_Vector,
  and Table_Vector_Array data types with wrapper functions.
  To standard_lseries_polynomials, added the construction of the table
  representations for the Jacobian matrix, tested by ts_lserpol.
  Fixed index error in standard_lseries_polynomials.adb.
  Tested evaluation of Jacobian in ts_lserpol.

Wed 24 Mar 2021 : added a proposed degree calculation to ts_lserpol.
  Improved in standard_lseries_polynomials the making of a series polynomial 
  and sharped the formula for the proposed degree in ts_lserpol.
  Extended standard_lseries_polynomials with code for Laurent systems,
  modified ts_lserpol.

Tue 23 Mar 2021 : new package test_standard_lseries_matrices, with code
  extracted from ts_laurmat.  To test_standard_lseries_matrices, added
  a specific test to demonstrate the LU factorization on a matrix series
  with a singular leading coefficient matrix.  New test procedure ts_lserpol
  to develop the polynomial evaluation and differentiation at Laurent series.
  New package standard_lseries_polynomials with code from ts_lserpol.

Mon 22 Mar 2021 : added a plain LU factorization to ts_laurmat.
  Added a first LU factorization with pivoting to ts_laurmat.
  Fixed the test in ts_laurmat on LU factorization with pivoting,
  added the LU with pivoting to the standard_linear_laurent_solvers.

Sun 21 Mar 2021 : fixed initialization of the matrix-vector product
  in ts_laurmat.  Added Is_Zero function to standard_laurent_series,
  extended ts_laurmat with a forward substitution solver.
  Modified ts_laurmat to control the seed of the random number generators.
  Added exponent_gap function to standard_laurent_series.
  To ts_laurmat, added a backward substitution solver.
  New package random_laurent_series with code taken from ts_laurmat.
  Move code from ts_laurmat into the package standard_linear_laurent_solvers.

Sat 20 Mar 2021 : moved all code for Laurent series from ../Series.
  New ts_laurmat to develop the matrix-vector product of Laurent series.
