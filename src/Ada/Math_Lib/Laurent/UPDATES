Tue 23 Mar 2021 : new package test_standard_lseries_matrices, with code
  extracted from ts_laurmat.

Mon 22 Mar 2021 : added a plain LU factorization to ts_laurmat.
  Added a first LU factorization with pivoting to ts_laurmat.
  Fixed the test in ts_laurmat on LU factorization with pivoting,
  added the LU with pivoting to the standard_linear_laurent_solvers.

Sun 21 Mar 2021 : fixed initialization of the matrix-vector product
  in ts_laurmat.  Added Is_Zero function to standard_laurent_series,
  extended ts_laurmat with a forward substitution solver.
  Modified ts_laurmat to control the seed of the random number generators.
  Added exponent_gap function to standard_laurent_series.
  To ts_laurmat, added a backward substitution solver.
  New package random_laurent_series with code taken from ts_laurmat.
  Move code from ts_laurmat into the package standard_linear_laurent_solvers.

Sat 20 Mar 2021 : moved all code for Laurent series from ../Series.
