Thu 10 Jun 2021 : added the exec_dir attribute to supports.gpr.

Tue 8 Jun 2021 : defined supports.gpr to build the test procedures.

Mon 4 Aug 2014 : new instantiations {dobl,quad}dobl_complex_veclists and io.

Thu 13 Jun 2013 : updated integer_support_functions for integer32.

Sun 9 Jun 2013 : about half the files in this directory changed because of
  the natural32 and integer32 types...

Fri 7 Jun 2013 : edits in generic_lists_of_vectors.

Wed 1 Jun 2011 : changed face_enumerators_utilities.adb for a warning.

Sun 29 May 2011 : changed integer_support_functions.adb for warnings of
  the GNAT GPL 2010 compiler.

Mon 24 Aug 2009 : added lists_of_integer64_vectors.ads
  and lists_of_integer64_vectors_io.ads.

Tue 12 Dec 2006 : renamed "lists_of_complex_vectors" and its _io into
  standard_complex_veclists (+ io), new multprec_complex_veclists (+io)
  for the convenient use of Aitken extrapolation.

Tue 10 Oct 2006 : added Creators to generic_arrays_of_vector_lists because
  conversion was needed in new polyhedral coefficient trackers.

Thu 2 Aug 2001 : added lists_of_complex_vectors + io, because needed in the
  monodromy factorization of complex multivariate polynomials.
