Homotopies, Newton's method and path trackers in PHCv2.4.85

Run "gprbuild deformations.gpr" to make all test programs.
On windows, type "gprbuild deformations.gpr -Xos=windows"
at the PowerShell prompt.
The "gprclean deformations.gpr" removes all files created by gprbuild.

This directory was newly created in version 2.3.75, collecting the
directories Homotopy, Newton, and Continuation.  The directory Continuation
was further subdivided into End_Games, Trackers, Sweep, and Continuation.
The directory Curves was added in version 2.3.79 and upgraded with
Newton methods on matrix series in version 2.4.23.

   Deformations         : 2. homotopies, Newton's method & path trackers
      |-- Solutions     : 2.1. solutions of systems and homotopies
      |-- Homotopy      : 2.2. homotopies, scaling and reduction
      |-- Newton        : 2.3. Newton's method, deflation, verification
      |-- Curves        : 2.4. univariate solving and algebraic curves
      |-- End_Games     : 2.5. polyhedral end games
      |-- Trackers      : 2.6. the path trackers
      |-- Sweep         : 2.7. sweeping for singularities

All programs defined by the code in Deformations require the homotopy
and the start solutions on input.
