Polyhedral homotopies by implicit lifting in PHCpack version 2.4.85

This directory contains software for the computation of mixed volumes,
according to the recursive formula Bershtein used in his proof.
Also the homotopy method of Bernshtein has been implemented.

The minor modification in release 2.2 is the addition of a black-box
routine to solve polynomials in one variable, using Durand-Kerner
(a.k.a. the method of Weierstrass), and a black-box solver for systems
with few monomials.  Since 2.3.06 a new fewnomial system solver exists,
and in release 2.3.11, the old fewnomial solvers were removed.

Support for 64-bit integer arithmetic was added in version 2.3.71.
Double double and quad double versions of the method of Weierstrass
(aka Durand-Kerner) were provided in version 2.3.79 and moved to a
new separate directory Curves.

Version 2.3.86 offered a tool to transform a Laurent polynomial system
with support sets of positive corank.

Run "gprbuild implift.gpr" to make all test programs.
On windows, type "gprbuild implift.gpr -Xos=windows"
at the PowerShell prompt.
The "gprclean implift.gpr" removes all files created by gprbuild.

This is the first implementation of polyhedral homotopy continuation.
Some design mistakes make it inefficient and hard to maintain, although
there is progress: fewnomial system solvers are revised and out.
Also the univariate solvers have been moved out.
