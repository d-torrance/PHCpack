  bracket polynomials into polynomial with double double and quad double
  precison coefficients.

Sat 17 Oct 2015 : new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_bracket_polynomials{_io}
  tested by ts_brackpols.  For systems of bracket polynomials, added the
  new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_bracket_systems{_io}.

Thu 15 Oct 2015 : extended evaluated_minors with functions in double double
  and quad double precision.

Wed 14 Oct 2015 : extended evaluated_minors with a Determinant function 
  of a matrix where the submatrix is defined by rows and columns brackets.

Tue 13 Oct 2015 : added <= operation to brackets as needed to define the
  'not above' in the partial order of brackets, needed in the efficient
  representation of Schubert problems.

Tue 18 Jun 2013 : updated bracket_systems, as needed in Pieri homotopies.

Mon 17 Jun 2013 : because of natural32 and integer32, more than half of all
  files in this directory changed.

Sun 30 Dec 2012 : ts_erememko.adb and ts_detrock.adb no longer compiled,
  fixed this.

  name of triangulations into standard_integer_triangulations.

Thu 9 Jun 2011 : changed drivers_for_sagbi_homotopies.adb for changed
  specifications of standard_root_refiners.

Wed 1 Jun 2011 : changed straightening_syzygies.adb for warning.

Sun 29 May 2011 : for GNAT GPL 2010 warnings, changed matrix_homotopies.adb,
  bracket_expansions.adb, and drivers_for_sagbi_homotopies.adb.

Tue 29 Dec 2009 : for GNAT GPL 2009 warnings: changed ts_brackets.adb,
  ts_brackmons.adb, ts_cheby.adb, ts_detrock.adb, sagbi_homotopies.adb,
  ts_local.adb, ts_sagbi.adb, ts_straighten, and bracket_monoials_io.adb.

Thu 3 Jan 2008 : updated brackets.adb, bracket_monomials.adb,
  bracket_polynomials.ad*, and bracket_systems.adb
  because of warnings of GNAT GPL 2006.

Wed 6 Jun 2007 : added put_line to bracket_systems_io.

Tue 5 Jun 2007 : fixed bug in bracket_polynomials_io and added put_line.

Mon 4 Jun 2007 : added a function "Dimension" to bracket_monomials and
  to bracket_polynomials.

Tue 27 Mar 2007 : get in bracket_monomials_io, tested by ts_brackmons.adb.
  Added type array_of_brackets to the brackets package.

Fri 23 Mar 2007 : added Null_Bracket_Poly to bracket_polynomials.

Wed 21 Mar 2007 : moved driver_for_sagbi_homotopies into drivers_for_* to
  postpone the reading of the name of the output file.
  The test programs ts_sagbi, ts_straighten, ts_detrock, and ts_eremenko
  changed as well.

Tue 20 Mar 2007 : extended bracket_monomials with array type and a function
  "Is_Null" to test whether a bracket monomials is null.  The distinction
  between copy_multiply and copy_append of bracket monomials also caused
  updates in bracket_polynomials, leading to a new frontal_add procedure.

Wed 4 Oct 2006 : upgrade of power_lists into supports_of_polynomial_systems
  caused change in driver_for_sagbi_homotopies.adb.

Wed 14 Jun 2006 : because of warnings on AIX, changed bracket_polynomials.adb
  and the package complex_osculating_planes.
