Numerical Schubert Calculus using SAGBI homotopies in PHCv2.4.85

This directory was delivered with release 2 of PHCpack, and stowed
away in a separate directory in release 2.2.

SAGBI homotopies are a concatenation of three homotopies:
1) polyhedral homotopies to set up the start system;
2) flat deformation using a Groebner basis for the Grassmannian;
3) Cheater's homotopy towards real target system.

Historically, SAGBI homotopies were the first tools in numerical
Schubert calculus, but were later outperformed (both in mathematical
beauty and efficiency) by the Pieri homotopies.

The equations in the Groebner homotopies are set up by means of the 
straightening algorithm.  Because the Groebner homotopies are not efficient,
they are only auxiliary to the set up of the SAGBI homotopies, which arise 
from expanding the brackets in the linear equations over the Grasmannian.

These homotopies were used to test some conjectures in real algebraic
geometry, formulated by the Shapiro brothers, with variants by Eremenko
and Gabrielov (who proved a version of the Shapiro conjectures).
