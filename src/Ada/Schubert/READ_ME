Numerical Schubert Calculus with PHCv2.4.85

Run "gprbuild schubert.gpr" to make all test programs.
On windows, type "gprbuild schubert.gpr -Xos=windows"
at the PowerShell prompt.
The "gprclean schubert.gpr" removes all files created by gprbuild.

This directory was delivered with release 2 of PHCpack,
with some minor updates in release 2.1 for the connection with C.
In release 2.2, the code for SAGBI and Pieri homotopies was
dispersed in two separate subdirectories, to make room for the
Littlewood-Richardson homotopies to implement Schubert Induction.
In release 2.3 most changes are in Induction.

The Littlewood-Richardson homotopies became available in double double
and quad double precision in version 2.4.03.

The organization of this library as part of the organization tree
of the source code of PHCpack is as follows:

   Schubert             : 5. numerical Schubert calculus
      |-- SAGBI         : 5.1 SAGBI homotopies
      |-- Pieri         : 5.2 deformations based on Pieri's rule
      |-- Induction     : 5.3 Littlewood-Richardson homotopies

The numerical Schubert calculus provides homotopy methods derived
from geometric root counting formulas.
