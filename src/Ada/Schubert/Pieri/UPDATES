  ts_piroco.adb for string representation of root counting posets.

  and drivers_for_quantum_pieri.adb  for changed specifications
  in standard_root_refiners.

Wed 1 Jun 2011 : changed deformation_posets.adb, determinantal_systems.adb,
  specialization_of_planes.adb, drivers_for_pieri_homotopies.adb,
  localization_posets_io.adb, and pieri_homotopies.adb for warnings.
