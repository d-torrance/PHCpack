OS dependent features and general utilities in PHCv2.4.85

New in the second release is the inclusion of test programs (prefix "ts_").
A timer interfacing with C was needed for the Windows platform and Itanium
machines, moved in release 2.3 to a separate subdirectory Basic_Timer.
The unix timing facilities were moved to the subdirectory Unix_Timer.
An extra procedure was added to communications_with_user in release 2.3.
Multithreading was added in release 2.3.39.  New in 2.3.58 is the package
string_splitters.

Run "gprbuild system.gpr" to make all test procedures.
On windows, type "gprbuild system.gpr -Xos=windows"
at the PowerShell prompt.
The "gprclean system.gpr" removes all files created by gprbuild.

A package like Unix_Command_Line is available in some form in most Ada
compiling systems.  For encapsulation purposes it is included here.

The file scanning operations are part of the database management of the
system input files to PHCpack.
