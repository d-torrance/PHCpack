Treatment and representation of solution components with PHCv2.4.85.

Run "gprbuild components.gpr" to make all test programs.
On windows, type "gprbuild components.gpr -Xos=windows"
at the PowerShell prompt.
The "gprclean components.gpr" removes all files created by gprbuild.

This directory was new in release 2.1 and under continueing development.
Release 2.2 offered a blackbox factorization for multivariate polynomials,
a first implementation of diagonal homotopies in extrinsic coordinates,
and a first attempt for an equation-by-equation solver.
Release 2.3 introduced intrinsic coordinates to sample and to intersect
varieties.  The subdirectory Solver was added in release 2.3 and contains
a preliminary version of a new equation-by-equation solver.
Release 2.3.48 contained the new directory Tropical.
Release 2.3.70 offered a first version of an irreducible decomposition
of the solution set of a binomial system.
A blackbox version (phc -B) for a numerical irreducible decomposition
was introduced in 2.4.46 and improved with multitasking in 2.4.52.

The organization of the library is organized as follows:

  Components           : 5. numerical irreducible decomposition 
     |-- Samplers      : 5.1 witness sets
     |-- Interpolators : 5.2 finding equations for components
     |-- Factorization : 5.3 factorization into irreducible components
     |-- Decomposition : 5.4 cascade homotopies to filter and factor
     |-- Solver        : 5.5 equation-by-equation solver
     |-- Tropical      : 5.6 tropical view on witness sets

The goal of the numerical irreducible decomposition is to decompose the
solution sets of various dimensions and degrees into irreducible components.
